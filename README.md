# HR Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This repository contains a data analytics project focused on human resources (HR) data. The dataset comprises 22,214 rows and 13 columns, with information about employees, including their ID, age, name, hire date, department, and termination date if applicable. The data was originally in a CSV file but has been loaded into a MySQL Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for analysis.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to perform comprehensive data analysis on the HR dataset. The analysis aims to extract valuable insights and patterns related to employee information, such as turnover rates, departmental trends, and more. By leveraging data analytics techniques, we hope to provide actionable recommendations for HR decision-makers.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following columns:

1. **Employee ID**: A unique identifier for each employee.
2. **Age**: The age of each employee.
3. **Name**: The name of the employee.
4. **Hire Date**: The date when the employee was hired.
5. **Department**: The department to which the employee belongs.
6. **Termination Date**: If applicable, the date when the employee left the company.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before analysis, the dataset underwent a thorough cleaning and preprocessing phase to ensure data quality and consistency. The steps involved in data preparation include:

- Handling missing data.
- Correcting data types.
- Removing duplicates.
- Ensuring data consistency.
- Validating date formats.
- Handling outliers if necessary.

## Data Analysis

The core of this project revolves around data analysis. We explore various aspects of the HR data, including:

- **Employee Demographics**: Understanding the age distribution and other demographic characteristics of employees.
